# Why am I learning Go?

I'm currently working within the dotnet ecosystem with MSSQL, C#, Azure, and primarily supporting marketing data integrations into various sytems, such as Snowflake, Unica, Salesforce Data Cloud, and other segmentation etc tools. This abstracts away much of the fun of software engineering, and that is something I am hungering to get a deeper understanding of. I am looking forward to building out various cool little projects and learning Go.

### Learning Path:
- Let's Go
- Let's Go Futher
