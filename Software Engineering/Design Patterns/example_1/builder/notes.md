# Builder Pattern

## Motivation
- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call
- Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create
- Having a factory function with 10 arguments is not productive
- Piecewise construction
- Builder provides an API for consctructing an object step-by-step
