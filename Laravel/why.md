# Why am I learning Laravel?

I need a full-stack framework that can allow for a fast solo-developer experience in creating "good-enough" web apps. PHP speed is okay, and Laravel is okay to code in. What matters for this need is the surrounding tooling, such as payment gateway integrations, auth, easy deployments, and fast feature turn-arounds.

### Learning Path:
- Laracasts

#### Laracasts
Laracasts is really good. It teaches PHP, Vue, React, Laravel, and all of Laravels toolings and framework add-ons.

Unfortunetly there are not too many other resources, but then again, Laracasts is very good.
